### Task 3:

Defamation is when words have been spoken or written that:
• harm your reputation in the eyes of ordinary people in the community,
• harm your reputation in your trade or profession (for example, lead you to get less work), or
• are likely to result in you being shunned, avoided, made fun of, or despised.
As a professional data scientist, you should learn the legal consequences of designing software.
In groups (4-5 students), discuss the following cases of legal lawsuits. Discuss whether the
information returned is considered defamation. Please explain how you would avoid such legal
consequences.

*• The radio talk show host Mark Walters has sued OpenAI for defamation. According to the
complaint, when a journalist prompted ChatGPT for information about an unrelated lawsuit,
the tool wrongly described Walters as a defendant in that case who had been accused of
fraud. Walters is seeking monetary compensation from the company for the reputational
damage allegedly caused by these false statements. 12*


*• In A.T. v. OpenAI, users are suing OpenAI for allegedly violating federal (ECPA) and state
(CIPA) wiretapping laws by collecting user data when they input content into ChatGPT or
into third-party websites’ search features that have integrated ChatGPT APIs. Users are also
alleging that OpenAI violates the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA), a federal
anti-hacking law, for the same action of collecting their user data (especially their metadata)
when using ChatGPT and ChatGPT plugins on third-party websites. 3*

### Task 4 :


Your fintech company developed an app for a digital bank. But recently several customers have
reported that they got scammed or they experienced an attempt of scam. A scam is a type of computer
fraud where people are asked to pay money for a legitimate reason (for example, buying stocks or
helping a friend) but the money goes to the scammers.
*Discuss what are the steps needed to be taken by your fintech company to prevent your customers
from getting scammed.*
