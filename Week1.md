## **Task3**

On a scale of (high, medium, and low) evaluate each one of the following opportunities for Continuing Professional Development (CPD).

In my opinion i will evaluate "a data scientist trying to learn web development" as a low. It's impact is not developing directly Data Scientists' data analysis, machine learning (ML) and  developing model skils. 

For me	"a data scientist trying to switch to machine learning engineer by learning how to code in pytorch" will have high impact on data sientists' CPD as Pytorch is popular in deep learning field and will increase professional skills in practical way.

I will evaluate "A data scientist applying for a master’s in finance" as a medium scale. In regards of analysing big quantative financial data is essential in businesses. Decision making based on real data analysis is effective. i could contribute to prevent from future risks and problems in business worlds.

## **Task4**

Evaluate if the computer professionals have maintained higher standards of commitment, integrity, responsibility, and accountability.

•	A data science team have signed a contract with a client to deliver software on a specific date. The team has failed to meet the deadline and the client lost money for pushing the deadline further.
On above scenatio the team could not work integrated, and was lack of commitment and responsibilty. Failing to fullfil the contract deadline requirement is irresponsible thing in the business. If delay forseen ahead the team should have informed the client to decrease the risks outcome.

•	A data science team has delivered a project to a client with the source code. The team asked the client to review the code and report back if he finds anything unusual.
For the above case I would comment that the data science team should not only rely on the customer review and quality check. As to assure final code check the client can be lack of professional skill to check and find the code error and abnormalities. So that the team should consider and cooperate internally for testing and assuring the quality standard of the code.


•	An AI team has received two similar datasets from two clients to build a prediction model. The team decided to train one model in both datasets without telling the clients that their dataset is being used to train other models.
The above practice is impractical and unethical action as it is breaching integraty and accountability not getting the client consent and permission approval and violating professional responsibility in handling the client's data. In case of client acknowledgement of his/her data misusage, it could lead to law suit and reputational harm.
