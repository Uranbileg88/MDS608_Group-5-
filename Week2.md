1.	Which principle do you think is most important to you??
Select one principle that you feel is particularly important or meaningful to you. Describe why this principle stands out to you, and provide an example of how it might guide your behavior in a professional setting.

I contend that the principle of "primacy of public interest" holds particular significance for me. This principle emphasizes prioritizing the public interest over individual or commercial interests, which aligns perfectly with my sense of responsibility as a professional and my awareness of contributing to society. For instance, in my professional endeavors, if a project has the potential to generate personal or corporate benefits but at the cost of public interests, I would unhesitatingly decline the project to ensure that my actions conform to moral and legal standards.

The code emphasizes recognizing limitations in one's knowledge and skills. Describe a situation where you might feel pressured to perform a task beyond your current expertise. How would you handle this ethically, following the code?

Reflect on the codeâ€™s emphasis on professional development. Why is continuous learning important in the ICT field, and how does this relate to maintaining ethical standards?
