1.	Which principle do you think is most important to you??
Select one principle that you feel is particularly important or meaningful to you. Describe why this principle stands out to you, and provide an example of how it might guide your behavior in a professional setting.

I contend that the principle of "primacy of public interest" holds particular significance for me. This principle emphasizes prioritizing the public interest over individual or commercial interests, which aligns perfectly with my sense of responsibility as a professional and my awareness of contributing to society. For instance, in my professional endeavors, if a project has the potential to generate personal or corporate benefits but at the cost of public interests, I would unhesitatingly decline the project to ensure that my actions conform to moral and legal standards.  

2.	Applying the Code in Real-World Situations:
Imagine a scenario where you might face a conflict between personal gain and public interest (e.g., using private data for a project without explicit consent). How would the ACS Code of Professional Conduct help guide your actions in this situation?

In accordance with the norms, I shall give precedence to the public interest and refrain from utilizing unauthorized private data. I will pursue legitimate solutions, such as obtaining requisite consents or seeking alternative data sources, to guarantee that my conduct conforms to ethical and legal stipulations. If I detect any phenomenon in a project that contravenes the public interest, I will denounce this project and report the entire project to the relevant departments.  


4.	Dealing with Limitations of Knowledge and Skills:
The code emphasizes recognizing limitations in one's knowledge and skills. Describe a situation where you might feel pressured to perform a task beyond your current expertise. How would you handle this ethically, following the code?


5.	Responsibility for Continuous Learning:
Reflect on the codeâ€™s emphasis on professional development. Why is continuous learning important in the ICT field, and how does this relate to maintaining ethical standards?


6.	Influence of the Code on Your Future Career:
In what ways do you think the ACS Code of Professional Conduct will influence your future career decisions? Describe how you plan to incorporate these ethical principles into your daily work as an ICT professional.
