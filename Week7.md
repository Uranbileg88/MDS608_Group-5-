Task 3 :

As a data science entrepreneur, you should learn how to get the most out of your product through software license agreements. There are several methods to license software.

In groups (4-5 students), discuss the following cases of software license agreements. Discuss whether you are in favor or against the proposed license change. Please explain your answer.

• Netflix offers three subscription plans (Basic, Standard, and Premium). As a Netflix member, you are charged monthly on the date you signed up. Netflix charges the same amount on different devices. But devices with bigger screens allow more people to watch.
o Proposed change: increase the fees for smart TVs.

Increasing Netflix fees for smart TVs is not a favorable licensing change, as it could alienate customers and damage the brand. Charging higher fees based on the device assumes that larger screens equate to higher value, which is not necessarily true for every user. This change may be perceived as unfair and discriminatory, leading to dissatisfaction and potentially driving customers to competing platforms.

Netflix's current tiered subscription model already accounts for different user needs, offering plans based on simultaneous streams and video quality rather than device type. This approach ensures simplicity and fairness while maintaining a broad customer base.

A better alternative to increasing fees for smart TVs could be introducing optional add-ons, such as enhanced features for specific devices, without forcing higher costs on users. Maintaining customer trust and satisfaction should remain Netflix's priority to sustain its competitive edge and long-term growth.

• GitHub codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. Codespaces is
available for free for individual use for up to 60 hours a month and comes with pay-as-yougo pricing afterwards. GitHub offers individuals 60 free hours a month and charges $0.18
USD per additional hour.
o Proposed change: increase the free quota for individual users.

Enhancing the free quota of GitHub Codespaces for individual users could be a positive step, as it increases accessibility and attracts more users to the platform. Streaming service can give some free hours to attract more developers, especially students and independent developers to test the platform without losing money. This would help increase adoption rates and cultivate a wider, more than ever before, active community.

On the business side, the change could lead to short-term revenue losses, but create longer-term value by turning free users into paying consumers like once they cross the extended quota or scale their projects. More usage, more visibility / advocacy for GitHub’s ecosystem.

But the decision should also take infrastructure costs into account -- and it must be sustainable. This, and other promotional or tiered free quotas depending on activity or educational institution could balance user satisfaction with managing the fiscal impact.


Task 4 :

Bespoke software is custom made to meet the needs of a single organization. It is one-off so no one else will have the software. Writing a good contract ensures the profitability and continuity of your business.

Discuss the following situations and write down the important clauses that should be in the contract before taking on these projects.

• Your company was approached by a financial institution to develop a Large Language Model (LLM) solution for customer care.

Building a Large Language Model (LLM) solution for financial institution customer care requires an iron clad contract to guarantee project success and safeguard both parties. Key clauses to include are:

Deliverables: A specification of what the LLM can do (e.g., natural language understanding, multi lingual capabilities, secure data handling) and a schedule.

Intellectual Property (IP) Rights: Clearly define from whom the financial institution would own the final LLM, whether ownership is shared between parties, or if your company would retain proprietary rights, particularly for reusable components.

Data Privacy and Security: Mandate robust protocols for handling sensitive customer data, compliance with relevant regulatory frameworks such as GDPR or HIPAA, and encryption, and access controls.

Payment Terms: Specify payment structure (upfront, milestone, post-delivery, etc.), promoting transparency and alignment in cash flow.

Performance Metrics: Specify metrics for success (e.g., accuracy rates, response times, and scalability) and testing protocols

Non-Disclosure Agreement: To ensure confidentiality of both parties’ personal or sensitive information.

Maintenance and Support: Outline responsibilities after deployment, defining terms for bug fixes, updates, and ongoing support.

Limitation of Liability and Indemnity: Set limits on liability as well as indemnification terms to mitigate risks, such as data breaches or claims by third-parties.

A contract of such a nature outlines expectations, accountability, and laying the foundation for a successful project over time.



• Your company was approached by an insurance company to develop an app to manage insurance claims.

For creating an app to deal with insurance claims for an insurance agency, a clearly defined contract is essential for the success of the project and minimizing risks. Key clauses to include are:

Scope of Work: Outline the app’s features, such as user registration, claim submission, document upload, status tracking, and integration with the insurer’s current systems. Define deliverables, timelines, and milestones.

Data Security and Compliance: Discuss how you will handle sensitive customer and financial data. Make sure you are compliant with applicable regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA (if applicable), or local data protection laws. Example answer might include (but are not limited to): encryption, secure authentication and periodic audits.

Ownership and Intellectual Property: Define who owns the app and its elements. If your company maintains proprietary tools or frameworks, include guidelines for licensing their use.

Payment Structure: Outline milestones with partial payments, terms for revisions, scope changes, or delays.

Performance Metrics: Clearly define performance metrics for the app, including uptime, response times, and scale.

Support and Maintenance: Specify post-deployment support responsibilities, including updates and bug fixes. If applicable, add terms for long-term maintenance contracts.

Liability and Indemnity: I limit my liability in case of a data breach or service failure while ensuring my app meets the specifications we agreed upon.

This kind of contract provides clear expectations, security, and cooperation of responsibility.
