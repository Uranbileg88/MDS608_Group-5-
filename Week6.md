Task 3:
As a data science entrepreneur, you should learn how to protect your company’s intellectual
property. In the past, there have been cases of software infringements. It’s important to know how
these infringements started, and how did these cases play out in court.

In groups (4-5 students), discuss the following cases of software infringements. Please explain how
you reached your conclusion.


• Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc. 
o Oracle (through subsidiary, Oracle America, Inc., originating from Sun Microsystems), claims that within early versions of the Android operating system, Google have used Java programming language's application programming interfaces (APIs) and about 11,000 lines of source code. Google admitted to using the APIs but claimed this was within fair use. 


The case of Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc. involved Google’s use of Java APIs in its Android operating system. Oracle, which had acquired Sun Microsystems (the company that developed Java), alleged that Google had copied an estimated 11,000 lines of Java code (including APIs) without a license. Google acknowledged the use but asserted that APIs are functional tools and such usage qualified as fair use. According to Google, it converted the Java APIs to a new and unique Android platform, thereby fostering a more open and competitive mobile development environment.

The case made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 2021 that Google did not infringe on Oracle’s copyright. The court found that Google’s use of the APIs was fair use because it used only those portions of the Java API that developers needed in order to create applications, which provided transformative value. The ruling made clear that reimplementation of functional code is, under certain conditions, itself a lawful activity that encourages innovation.”

This case illustrates the blurred lines that often characterize the balance between protecting intellectual property — particularly, software — and hindering technological innovation. To help avoid risks of infringement, entrepreneurs in data science should obtain appropriate licensing or prove fair use, focusing on the transformative nature of their enterprise.



• Microsoft v. Lindows.com, Inc. 
o was a court case brought by Microsoft against Lindows, Inc in December 2001, claiming that the name “Lindows” was a violation of its trademark “Windows.”

In the trial of Microsoft v. Lindows.com, Inc, Microsoft claimed that "Lindows “(used by Lindows.com), an act of infringement on its trademark "Windows". Microsoft argued that the "Lindows ‘ was much too close to "Windows "and this could potentially confuse consumers into thinking that the two products were related. This was countered by Lindows.com, who said in the same year that "Windows " was a computer term used to describe graphical user interfaces and windowsl environments. By then the term could be seen as in general use for over a decade ahead of Microsoft's introduction of this usageThe case brought attention to the fine line between generic terms and trademarks. If a trademarked term becomes widely used to describe a general concept (e.g., "thermos" or "escalator"), it risks losing its legal protection—a concept known as genericide. Lindows.com sought to challenge the validity of Microsoft's trademark, arguing that "Windows" had become generic.The dispute was eventually settled out of court in 2004, with Microsoft paying Lindows.com $20 million, and Lindows rebranding itself as Linspire, Inc. While the case didn't conclusively establish whether "Windows" was a generic term, it at least reminded companies about importance of clear branding and trademark strategy. That means entrepreneurs should play it safe when choosing names by thinking creatively and avoid selecting terms that could become common or unprotectable and yet be aware of the problem posed by weakening one's own trademarks.


Task 4 :

Computer software can be considered as a patentable invention. As an entrepreneur you might consider filing for a patent to protect your software and to gain business advantage. But there are some issues in filing for a patent. First, patent applications are costly (they typically cost typically cost $30,000-$50,000 over their lifetime in the US alone1 ). Second, you need to draft and defend your patent application which requires investing a considerable time and effort.
Discuss the following situations and evaluate whether filing for a patent is worth it from the business perspective.

• You started a company that offers Large Language Model (LLM) solutions to financial institutions. 

If very specifically your Large Language Model (LLM) solutions are targeted towards financial institutions, then filing a patent can bring significant competitive advantages in two ways: deterring copyists from infringing on your intellectual property and actually trying to invent competition by securing that idea for yourself. Cost is a big issue at a high level: $50000-$30K plus significant time outlay needs to be debated against stage of growth and market dynamics. If your solution has unique, non-obvious innovations critical to its functionality, a patent can establish a strong market position and attract investors. Conversely, quick advancements in AI could make patents less relevant due to technological obsolescence. In any case, trade secrets or faster innovation cycles may be more practical based on your stage of development and market conditions.

• Your company launched a python deep learning library that is faster than pytorch. 

When comparing the Python deep learning libraries and PyTorch, filing a patent might not make sense On the one hand, "lib exclusion layer" is just too abstract. On the other hand it would lose functionality as libraries undergo rapid changes. So if we make sure our library has its copyrights in place and focus on promoting brand, getting it into wide use, and doing innovation, that's more effective.

 • Your company designed a physical keyboard for the ipad.

For the iPad keyboard, a patent has value if the form or mechanism is novel and non-obvious. It achieves market exclusivity, discourages competitors, and raises the product's price. We need to weigh the high cost of this type of patent against what our product will be worth in markets could reach soon.

• Your company released a messaging app with a new layout and modern look.

While you can always file a patent — a unique layout and a more modern look for a messaging app is probably not the most practical, though — UI designs are often hard to patent unless you're doing something that requires an innovative and non-obvious technical solution. Most of the time UI elements are protected with copyrights that cover the visual and aesthetic aspects of the design. A further business value can be gained through trademarks that build brand recognition and a unique identity to serve as further deterrents to business detractors.

I also suspect time and cost involved in patenting would outweigh benefits in the always-evolving and competitive app space. Instead, focus on user experience optimization, constant updates, and solid marketing, and let that create your competition barrier. If the new layout includes unique technical mechanisms or algorithms that consider the novelty in that regard, patenting would be worthwhile in order to protect innovations, obtain market differentiation, and attract investors/partners.
