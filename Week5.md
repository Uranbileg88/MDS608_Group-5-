## Task 3 :
In groups (4-5 students), on a scale of (high, medium, and low) evaluate each one of the following
projects:
• Build a new complex anomaly detection model to notice any tiny trends in customer
behavior the moment they arise.

Goal: Identify subtle trends in customer behavior as soon as they emerge.

Influence on the Business: High
Early detection of trends can drive proactive decisions, improve customer experience, and potentially lead to significant business advantages. This has a strong business impact.

Likelihood of Success: Medium
While feasible, the project’s complexity depends on the quality of data and the expertise of the team. Building and validating such a model could be challenging but achievable with the right resources.

Joy for Data Scientists: High
This is a challenging and impactful project that pushes technical skills and creativity, which most data scientists find exciting.

• Automate a manual report the business uses into a dashboard.
Goal: Convert a repetitive, manual report into an automated and interactive dashboard.

Influence on the Business: Medium
While automation saves time and increases efficiency, its business influence is often limited to operational improvements rather than strategic outcomes.

Likelihood of Success: High
Automation is typically a straightforward task for most data science teams, especially with modern dashboarding tools like Tableau or Power BI.

Joy for Data Scientists: Low
While useful, this task is generally less exciting or challenging for data scientists, as it leans more toward operational work than innovative data science.

• Add natural language processing to an existing part of the product so customer input can
be categorized.
To evaluate and prioritize the given projects, we’ll apply the three-question framework and assess each project on a scale of high, medium, or low for each criterion: influence on the business, likelihood of success, and joy for the data science team. Here's the breakdown:

Goal: Categorize customer input using NLP to improve the product's functionality.

Influence on the Business: High
Improving customer input categorization could enhance product usability and customer satisfaction, leading to better retention and engagement.

Likelihood of Success: High
NLP techniques are mature and widely available. With pre-trained models and libraries like SpaCy or Hugging Face, the team is likely to succeed.

Joy for Data Scientists: Medium to High
Many data scientists enjoy working with NLP due to its growing relevance and the opportunity to directly impact customer interactions, but the excitement level might depend on the complexity of the implementation.



## Task 4:

The process for making decisions about a team’s technical infrastructure is as important as the actual
decisions. The leader of the data science team may be making these decisions directly, or it may be a
person on the team like the technical lead or a principal data scientist who has the final call. The
technical infrastructure involves the tools and programming languages the data scientists use.
Discuss the following decisions about technical infrastructure from the data scientist’s and the
business perspectives.
• Data scientists are given laptops and can use whatever tool set and programming language
they want so long as they finish the assigned work well.

Data scientists Perspective: This approach gives the team maximum flexibility to work with tools they are most comfortable and efficient with. 
It can lead to higher satisfaction and quicker problem-solving since team members can tailor their workflow to their preferences.  

Business Perspective: While this allows creativity, it can result in significant challenges for collaboration, system integration, 
and long-term maintainability. The lack of standardization could increase costs and inefficiencies, particularly when onboarding 
new team members or scaling projects.

• Data scientists are allowed to use the programming language and library they want on their
laptops but are encouraged to use tools that align with the existing cloud platform
whenever possible.

Data Scientist’s Perspective: This strikes a balance by allowing them to choose tools while gently guiding them to align with 
existing systems. It supports innovation and creativity without imposing strict limitations, enabling efficient workflows that 
benefit both the individual and the team.

Business Perspective: Encouraging alignment ensures that the tools and platforms used are compatible with the company’s 
infrastructure, reducing integration issues. It supports scalability and collaboration while still offering room for innovation.


• Data scientists are required to use cloud infrastructure, Python, and a specific set of ML
libraries. Other tooling can be used, but they first need the approval of the technical lead.

Data Scientist’s Perspective: Having a clear set of tools provides structure and consistency, 
which can streamline collaboration. However, requiring approval for alternative tools may feel 
restrictive and could slow down work if approval processes are lengthy.

Business Perspective: Standardizing tools improves compatibility, security, and efficiency. 
While it limits experimentation, it ensures smooth collaboration and reduces the risk of 
introducing unsupported technologies.

• Data scientists must only use exactly the toolset allowed by the technical leader, the
manager, and DevOps.

Data Scientist’s Perspective: This approach can feel overly restrictive, limiting creativity and the ability to 
experiment with new tools or methods. It may also decrease job satisfaction and innovation in the long term.

Business Perspective: Strict control ensures complete standardization, system integration, and adherence to security protocols. 
However, it risks stifling innovation and could lead to talent retention issues if data scientists feel overly constrained.
