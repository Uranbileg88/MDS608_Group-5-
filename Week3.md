Task 1:

Whistleblowers play an important role in identifying and calling out misconduct and harm to consumers and the community. To encourage whistleblowers to come forward with their concerns and protect them when they do, the Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act) gives certain people legal rights and protections as whistleblowers.
Read the following situations and discuss if it is required to blow the whistle:

•	A member in a data science team has noticed that several data science team did not take the proper measures to anonymize the identity of the users before building the data science tools.

- In this case it will be proper solution for the data science team to whistle blow. It is crucial to properly anonymize user data in order to ensure privacy and to comply with legal and ethical requirements. The organization's reputation can be damaged and sensitive information could be exposed if this step is missed. As a result of the Corporations Act 2001, whistleblowers are protected in situations such as this, where there is the possibility of significant harm to consumers or communities. It would be beneficial to speak up here in order to ensure that data privacy standards are met, thereby protecting both the users and the organization.

•	A data science team has agreed with a client to perform a project. The team received the funding from that client, and started funding other projects that the team already has, without notifying the client.

- There may be a case for whistleblowing in this situation. It is unethical to use client funds for unrelated projects without notifying them in advance. The importance of speaking up would contribute to the maintenance of transparency and ethical standards.

•	In a meeting with a client, one data scientist noticed that not all information was given to the client. He also noticed that the client was given unrealistic deadlines to finish the project.

- There are concerns regarding honesty and fair dealing in this case. Setting impractical deadlines and failing to provide complete information can have adverse effects on the client relationship and the success of the project. Bringing this issue to the attention of the organization internally could help prevent further harm and align the project with ethical and professional standards.

  
Task 2:

Case Study: Data Analysis at ABC Solutions
Background
ABC Solutions is an IT consulting firm specializing in data analysis and business intelligence. Recently, it was hired by a large retail chain, XYZMart, to analyze customer purchase data. The goal is to identify purchasing patterns and improve XYZMart's targeted advertising efforts. XYZMart provided ABC Solutions with a dataset containing sensitive customer information, including names, addresses, email addresses, purchase histories, and even transaction times and locations.

The Ethical Dilemma

Jordan is a data analyst at ABC Solutions and was assigned to the XYZMart project. During the analysis, Jordan realizes that some of the data could be used to identify individual customers’ habits, such as when they are likely to be at home or away based on their shopping patterns.

At the same time, Jordan’s friend Taylor, who works for a competing retail chain, reaches out and casually asks for “tips” on ABC Solutions' work, mentioning that they are looking for ABCs to improve their store’s advertising. Taylor even suggests that Jordan could help by sharing a few “non-specific ABCs” without giving away XYZMart’s confidential data. In exchange, Taylor offers to introduce Jordan to job openings at the competitor’s company, which could be a significant career boost for Jordan.

Questions for Analysis
Using the ACS Code of Ethics, analyze the ethical issues Jordan is facing and recommend actions Jordan should take to resolve the dilemma. Refer to specific ACS principles to justify your analysis.


- In this Task 2 example, Jordan who is dealing with sensitive data is facing following 2 types of ethical issues.
1. Confidentiality issue. Sharing XYZMart’s information to any third party is violating ACS Privacy regulations. In addition to compromising the confidentiality of clients, sharing insights from XYZMart's data, even in a vague form, violates the Trustworthiness and Privacy principles of the ACS Code.
2. Conflict of Interest issue. If Jordan accepts Taylor's offer, he would violate the principles of Honesty and Trustworthiness, as this would undermine Jordan's loyalty to ABC Solutions and XYZMart.

Recommended actions as follows:
Firstly, in order to Protect Confidentiality it is a must for Jordan to refuse to share XYZMart's any data.
Secondly, it might be useful for Jordan to report this matter to the manager to prove his trustworthiness to ABS Solution.
Thirdly, Jordan should reject the offer in a polite way.
Lastly, if needed Jordan can consult with his company's ethics and complience team. We believe the above actions are aligning with the ACS Code of ethics, managing professional integrity and trust properly.
