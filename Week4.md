## Task 1 

There are different forms of business ownership. The most common business structures are sole trader, a partnership, and a company. It is important to take a decision about the type of business you run as early as possible. The decisions you make early on can affect many areas of your business, including the licenses you need, how much tax you pay, and the volume of paperwork required.
In groups, read the following situations and discuss what is the best type of business structure to go for:
•	A web developer works in a day job for a financial organization. In the free time, the web developer takes requests to design personal websites, and charge clients by hourly rate.
Sole Trader is the best business structure for the above scenario.
This is the simplest option, ideal for individuals working alone. It’s easy to set up, requires minimal paperwork, and allows the developer to keep full control of their work. The web developer can report their freelance income on their personal tax return. However, they should be aware that as a sole trader, they are personally liable for any debts or issues related to the business.


•	Two fresh data science graduates agreed to take projects from clients. One data scientist is responsible for designing dashboards, the other handles machine learning tasks.
A partnership is suitable here as it allows both individuals to share responsibilities and profits based on their agreement. They can divide tasks according to their expertise and operate collaboratively. However, they need a clear partnership agreement to outline profit-sharing, decision-making, and how disputes will be resolved. It's important to note that partners are personally liable for the business's debts.


•	A fresh data science graduate has this great idea for designing an app that helps students manage their finances. She got a working prototype and started presenting it to investors. At one point, she was approached by an investor who promised to secure funding for her app in return to be a partner. 
Company would be the most appropriate business structure for this case.
Forming a company, such as a private limited company, is the most suitable choice. It offers limited liability, meaning the graduate’s personal assets are protected. The investor can hold shares in the company, formalizing their involvement and funding contribution. Additionally, operating as a company can enhance credibility when dealing with investors and stakeholders. However, this structure comes with more paperwork, regulatory compliance, and tax obligations.


## Task 2 

Corporate governance is the system by which companies are directed and controlled. Boards of directors are responsible for the governance of their companies. The shareholders’ role in governance is to appoint the directors and the auditors and to satisfy themselves that an appropriate governance structure is in place.
Executive tem is a group of senior executives or managers, normally led by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), responsible for the day-to-day operations and execution of the company’s strategies.
Read the following tasks and discuss whether it falls under the responsibility of the board of directors or the executive team:

•	A big tech company is planning to acquire a small startup to integrate their new solution into the company’s web services.

Responsibility: Board of Directors
Major strategic decisions, such as acquisitions, fall under the board’s responsibility. The board evaluates whether the acquisition aligns with the company’s overall goals, approves the investment, and ensures it adheres to governance principles. The executive team may be involved in executing the details of the acquisition, but the final decision rests with the board.


•	A company has two data science teams working in two different time zones. Merging the teams would be more efficient for the business.

Responsibility: Executive Team
Operational decisions, such as restructuring teams to improve efficiency, are typically handled by the executive team. They assess the logistics, coordinate the merger, and implement strategies to ensure the teams function effectively post-merger. The board would not usually intervene in such day-to-day operational matters unless they have broader strategic implications.



•	An investigation in a company has revealed serious misconduct by one member of the board. That member needs to be replaced.

Responsibility: Board of Directors
The board of directors is responsible for maintaining its integrity and ensuring proper governance. They would lead the process to address the misconduct, potentially through an internal investigation or external advisors. Replacing a board member typically involves a formal procedure overseen by the board, with shareholder involvement if required, such as in voting for a replacement during a general meeting.
