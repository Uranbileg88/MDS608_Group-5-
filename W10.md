### Task 4:

You are part of a research team in an AI company. Your tasks include training and testing AI models
and reporting your findings in the form of research papers.
Discuss what are the steps that need to be taken by your research team in the following cases.

*• Your team is collaborating with a professor at the university. The professor has made
intellectual contribution to the work. Should you list the professor’s name as an author, or

• Your team is collaborating with another research team. The results of the research are
promising and your have decided to send the paper for publication without consulting with
